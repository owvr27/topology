📘 Corporate Network Design - README

🔧 Project Overview
This project presents a scalable corporate network designed using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network simulates departments including HR, IT, and Finance, with efficient subnetting, routing, QoS, and security features.

---

🏗 Network Topology
- Devices: Routers, switches, PCs for each department.
- Departments: HR, IT, Finance.
- Hierarchical topology for scalability and manageability.

---

🧮 Subnetting & IP Addressing
- VLSM used to create optimized subnets.
- Each department has a unique subnet.
- Documented:
  - Network IDs
  - Broadcast addresses
  - Usable host ranges

---

🌐 Routing Configuration
- Static Routing used for specific direct paths.
- Dynamic Routing with EIGRP:
  - Autonomous System configured.
  - Enables communication between all departments.
  - Supports fast convergence and efficient path selection.

---

🎯 Quality of Service (QoS)
- QoS policies applied to prioritize:
  - Voice traffic (VoIP)
  - Video conferencing traffic

---

🔐 Security Implementation
- VLANs used to segment departmental traffic.
- Basic access controls configured for added isolation.

---
